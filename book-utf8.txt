For the twentieth time a passing train-man was asked the same question.

“The good Lord only knows,” he growled down into the face of the young
woman whose prettiness would have enticed the most chivalrous attention
from him earlier in the evening. “Engine and tender been gone three
hours and the divisional point only twenty miles up the line. Should
have been back with help long ago. Hell, ain’t it?

“Three hours!” the trainman continued his growling as he went on with
his lantern. “That’s the hell o’ railroading it along the edge of the
Arctic. When you git snowed in you’re _snowed in_, an’ there ain’t no
two ways about it!”

He paused at the smoking compartment, thrust in his head for a moment,
passed on and slammed the door of the car after him as he went into the
next coach.
