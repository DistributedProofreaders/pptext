<pre>03.15.19: Analysis of ambiguous close quote

	From <i>Luck of the Kid</i>:

	  And he handed me all these ‘God’s blessings’ that aren’t never content.

	could be

	  The preacher said ‘God’s blessings’ power is immense’ before he left.

	Same punctuation in the same order, but the close quote is after
	"blessings" in first example and after "immense" in second example.
	This will be mis-handled by the blessings’ -> blessing aspell check.
	I may need to add a near-quote resolution piece, but if I do that has
	to work across lines.</pre>

<pre>03.15.19: Runes versus characters

	Regex limitations need to be understood with respect to UTF-8. The usual
	word boundary expressions fail when adjacent to multi-byte UTF-8
	representations. Example from ppscan:

	  will thus form another _raison d’@être_ for the additional volumes.

	The apostrophe is internal and should not have been questioned. Go
	language rune handling handles this correctly in pptext.</pre>


<pre>03.15.19: False positive triggered by spelling error

	This is flagged as a suspect:

	  JUNIOR TRAVELLERS’ CLUB

	The algorithm takes TRAVELLERS’ to TRAVELLER and then looks that up
	in aspell. It concludes "traveller" is not a word, so the protection
	algorithm fails, the apostrophe is not classified, and the scan
	program flags it as an unclosed close quote. This is a false positive
	(from the scan) that is actually an error (from the typo).</pre>

<pre>03.15.19 catchable error missed [FIXME]

	Here is the internal coding of a passage from a book that contains an error:

	  Here a new voice contributed to the conversation. Its contribution,
	  though imperfectly understood, appeared to be “Nar! Why sh▿d I wite for
	  a little Jew in ⸢is dressin⸣ gown? Little Jews in their dressin▵ gowns
	  ▾as their drinks, and we ▾as our drinks. Bitter, miss.”

	In the original text, part of it shows as:

	  a little Jew in ‘is dressin’ gown

	Since the open quote is turned as shown, it has to be considered an open
	single quote. The "’is" -> "his" code cannot kick in (which would uncover
	the error). It appears as a quoted phrase and is not flagged though it is
	an error.

	That said, it should have been flagged because coincidentally the phrase
	ends with "in’" such that "dressin’" -> "dressing" will resolve to an
	apostrophe, such that the internal form would be:

	  a little Jew in ⸢is dressin▵ gown

	That should have flagged as an unclosed open single quote.</pre>
